# Husky

Custom scripts for osc mixers.

Run the following: `python3 main.py`

For Macs, run `./pyinstller.sh` to create `Husky.app` within the `dist` directory.

## config.py

This is the file that contains the config for your particular setup. These are the particular settings in the file:

### personal

This is a list of the typical personal that you want to save settings for. For each personal, you can specify `channels` and `iem_bus`. These are the target channel and in ear bus for the particular person. If you leave one blank, then it will not save down the particular settings for that person.

### osc

These are the default IP Addresses for `foh` and `iem` mixers. Note that the port is fixed to connect to 10023, which is the X32 default OSC port.

### serverMidi

This contains the name of the name of the default port to listen to, for incoming MIDI commands to this program.

### midi

These are the default MIDI ports to connect to for each particular category of midi commands. Note that `Husky` is a virtual MIDI port that is opened by this application that can be used by all programs on the computer running this app.

#### default

This is the name of the default port to connect to.

#### type

This is the type of midi call to make. Valid options currently are: `cc` and `note`.

#### defaultChannel

This is the default channel to send midi commands on. Should be a number between 1-16.

### faders

This is a list of default settings to load into the faders. The commands are in the following format:

```
[foh|iem] [command] [min float value] [max float value]
```

or for MIDI cues (note that fader only makes sense for control change commands)

```
midi [audio] [channel] [control]
```

On fader change, a corrosponding command will be fired. For OSC commands, this would send a float value between min and max arguement. For MIDI commands, this would send MIDI value equal to the slider position.

### talkbackChannel

This is the channel that FOH talkback is being sent through. Applicable because FOH Talkback Channel is sent to IEM Mixer.

## resetCommands

Commands to be fired on reset call.

## Data Directory

Data directory contains files that are created and used by this program. The directory has the following types of files:

*Note that for both file formats, the first line is not read by the program.*

### osc

These contain osc commands in the following format:

```
[foh|iem] [command] [str|int|float] [value] [(optional, for floats only) fade time]
```

For float values only, you are also able to optionally provide a 5th arguement to specify how long you want to take to fade in the new value.

You are also able to fire MIDI cues, by putting commands in the following format:

```
midi [audio|video|light] [channel:1-16] [control:0-127] [value:0-127]
```

### cue

This is a file to save down the cues to be files. It contains lines in the following format:

```
[key:A-G] [vocalLead:1-4] [snippet filename]
```

## Shortcuts

### Cues

There are 3 different options to fire cues:

1. Press the "Fire" button next to the cue
2. Use cmd+\<cue number\> to fire that numbered cue (Note that Cue 10 is fired by cmd+0. Also cmd+\<page name\> will change pages)
3. Send a MIDI cue, as configured in the `MIDI Input` page in the connection tab.
